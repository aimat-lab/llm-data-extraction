# Defense
There are two documents:
- [main_present.pdf](main_present.pdf): Presentation, including 'one-after-the-other' iteration through lists etc.
- [main_handout.pdf](main_handout.pdf): All final presentation slides, and some additional notes that would otherwise be spoken during the presentation.

Additionally, this directory contains all files for building these two documents, partially sorted by the following subdirectories:
- `chapters`: `TeX`-code for the individual chapters.
- `code`: `python` code snippets referenced in thesis and presentation. Symlink to `../thesis_document/code`.
- `img`: all images (also for the thesis). They are accredited on usage in either document. Symlink to `../thesis_document/img`.
