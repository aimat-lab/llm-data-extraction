    \begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
        \item Zero-shot automated information extraction from scientific literature was successfully demonstrated.
        \item Capabilities of different open-access \glspl{LLM} where measured and compared. Furthermore, frequent mistakes where analyzed and provided insight in failure modes.
        \item Fine-Tuning was substantially harder than initially assumed, and eventually abandoned for this work.
