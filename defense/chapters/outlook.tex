    A number of questions where answered, this newfound knowledge provides the opportunity to ask better questions.
    \begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
        \item How many of the unresolved \tsolv cases where actually correct?
        \item What is the accuracy of a correctly modeled \tadd?
        \item How can the prompt be improved?
        \item How does zero-shot accuracy compare with fine-tuned models?
        \item How do these models compare with next-gen models such as \gls{GPT4} or \gls{falcon}-180B?
        \item How do \glspl{LLM} compare to established \glspl{masked} for \gls{NER}?
    \end{itemize}
