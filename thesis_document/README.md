# Thesis Document
See the [main.pdf](main.pdf) as the most recent artifact.


Additionally, all files for building the thesis document are included in this directory, sorted according to these subdirectories:
- `include`: `TeX`-code relevant for setup and configuration.
- `chapters`: `TeX`-code for the individual chapters.
- `code`: `python` code snippets referenced in thesis and presentation.
- `figures`: `TeX`-code for figures. These parts of code are included in the main presentation and include references to images and descriptions.
- `img`: all images (also for the defense presentation). They are accredited on usage in either document.
