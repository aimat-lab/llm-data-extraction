\chapter{Approach}\label{chap:approach}
Chapter on {\em how} I used the language models, what I tried, and what didn't work / I settled on.

See \subref{list} for a list of the models used, \subref{criteria} for selection criteria and the respective Subsection for more details on each model.

\section{Prompts}\label{sec:prompts}

used a form of guidance \cite{guidance_2023}

\section{Supervised Fine Tuning}\label{sec:sft}
Was attempted multiple ways, utterly failed

How much should I write about?

curiousity with \verb`input_ids` and \verb`labels`? resulted in broken model, probably learned that it's 'finished', only outputting EOS tokens. Not sure if doing this otherwise would actually change anything though

Attempts at mask manipulation: not possible with causalLMs (they are all of this type)

SFT: only published about 1months before deadline, a lot of magic that isn't documented properly, at all. Couldn't get it to run, gave up due to time limit.

\section{Comparison}
criteria for comparing the outputs with labels
