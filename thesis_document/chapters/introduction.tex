\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Basics}
A large amount of scientific knowledge is scattered across millions of research
papers. Often, this research is not in standardized machine-readable formats,
which makes it difficult or impossible to build on prior work using powerful
tools to extract further knowledge.  \todo{expand on LLMs and limits here?}

\section{Motivation}
Take for example the field of synthesizing Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)
\cite{zhou_introduction_2012}. While numerous detailed descriptions of
synthesis procedures exist, they are not available in machine-readable formats,
which prevents effective application of state-of-the-art techniques such as
automated experimentation \cite{shi_automated_2021} or synthesis prediction
\cite{luo_mof_2022}. Thus, we intend to create a pipeline for deriving
machine-readable information on MOF synthesis parameters from given questions
on provided scientific articles.
