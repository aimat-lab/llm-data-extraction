\section{7B Parameter Models}\label{sec:result:7b}
As can be seen in \figref{7b_acc}, most models achieve decent accuracies in extracting \ttemp and \ttime data.
Most models hover just below 60\% in \tsolv accuracy, with \model{vicuna} being an outlier, achieving an accuracy of only 27\%.

\section{13B Parameter Models}\label{sec:result:13b}
See \figref{13b_acc}. 
\model{vicuna} substantially improved its \tsolv accuracy compared to its 7B variant, where it is now only 10 \glspl{pp} behind \model{llama} and \model{llama2}.
\model{vicuna} 13B is also the weakest in accuracy for \ttemp and \ttime, trailing by about 14 \glspl{pp}.

\section{Large Models}\label{sec:result:large}
See \figref{large_acc}. As much as scores between models differ in \secref{result:7b}, differences between large models are marginal at best
