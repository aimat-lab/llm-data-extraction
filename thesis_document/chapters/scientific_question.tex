\chapter{Scientific Question}
The goal of this work is to use large language models to demonstrate automated
extraction of unstructured text from scientific literature for the creation of
a database with otherwise non-machine readable information on MOF synthesis. By
doing so, we create a training pipeline that can be a) self-hosted and b)
adapted to other data extraction tasks. It may be provided as a service for
other research groups.

In this work, we will use OPT \cite{zhang_opt_2022} to empirically test how
much accuracy can be improved via 1) fine-tuning and 2) prompt engineering.
Additionally, we intend to 3) test how accuracy and compute requirements will be
affected by reduction of model size via distillation \cite{sun_patient_2019}.
A reduction in parameters would make it considerably less compute intensive to
run the final model.
