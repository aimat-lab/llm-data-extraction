        On the left is the average over all 7B sized models.
        The accuracy of \ttemp and \ttime is within 3 \glspl{pp} of the other for each model except \model{llama}, where the difference is 30 \glspl{pp}.
        On average, the accuracy for \ttemp is 78\%, 73\% for \ttime, and 56\% for \tsolv.
