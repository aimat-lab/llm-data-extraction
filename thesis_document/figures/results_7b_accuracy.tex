        \caption[Overview of 7B Models Accuracy]{\textbf{Overview of the Accuracy of Models with a Size of 7B parameters.}
        On the left is average over all 7B sized models.
        Accuracy on \ttemp and \ttime is within 3 \glspl{pp} of the other, for each model except for \model{llama}, where the difference is 30 \glspl{pp}.
        For most models, accuracy on \tsolv prediction is a few \glspl{pp} below 60\%, where \model{vicuna} is an outlier with only 27\% accuracy.
        \model{llama2} has the highest accuracy for both \ttemp and \ttime, but \model{falcon} is slightly more accurate in \tsolv prediction on our dataset.
