            On average, 7B sized models had an accuracy of 72\% on the extraction of the synthesis duration, and a third of the mistakes (11\% of 28\% total mistakes), were simply due to getting the unit of the duration wrong.
            \model{llama} struggled the most, providing inaccurate units for about a third of all answers on \ttime.
            Both \model{falcon} and \model{falcon}-instruct confused units in about 11\% of answers.
            However, \model{vicuna} and \model{llama2} gave the wrong unit in only 1\% of cases.
