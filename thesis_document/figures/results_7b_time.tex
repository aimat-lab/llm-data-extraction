            On average, 7B sized models had an accuracy of 72\% on the extraction of the synthesis duration.
            A third of the mistakes on \ttime extraction (10\% of 27\% total mistakes), were simply due to getting the unit of the duration wrong.
            Apart from \model{vicuna} and \model{llama2}, all models sized 7B struggled with time units to a certain degree, in particular \model{llama}, and less so \model{falcon}.
