        Leftmost is the average over all models.
        The accuracy for \ttemp and \ttime is within a few percantage points of 95\% for all models.
        For \tsolv, accuracy is still mostly around 60\%. \model{vicuna} 33B is still trailing behind (there is no \model{vicuna} 65B variant available from \gls{lmsys}).
        The accuracy of \model{llama} 30B on \tsolv is worse than that of any other \model{llama} size, being only slightly ahead of \model{vicuna}.
