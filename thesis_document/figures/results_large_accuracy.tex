        Leftmost is the average over all models.
        The accuracy for almost all \ttemp and \ttime is around within a few percantage points of 95\%.
        For \tsolv, accuracy is still mostly around 60\%. \model{vicuna} 33B is still trailing behind (there is no \model{vicuna} 65B variant available).
        The accuracy of \model{llama} 30B on \tsolv is worse than that of any other \model{llama} size, trailing not too far behind \model{vicuna}.
