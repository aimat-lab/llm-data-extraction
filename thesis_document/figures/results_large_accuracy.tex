        \caption[Overview of Large Model Accuracy]{\textbf{Overview of the Accuracy of Models with a Size over 30B parameters.}
        Leftmost is the average over all models upwards of 30B parameters.
        On average, the accuracy for \ttemp is 98\%, 97\% for \ttime and 68\% for \tsolv.
        \model{llama2} does not have a 30B or 33B-sized variant.
        There is also no \model{vicuna}-65B variant made available from \gls{lmsys}.
        \model{llama2} and both \model{falcon} models achieve 72\% accuracy on \tsolv extraction, 6-11 \glspl{pp} more than other models.
